Implementation of RNNs using Long-Short term memory Network Model and Decision Tree Regressors for Stock Prediction

Here I propose a hybrid approach com-
bining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decision Tree
Regression for stock prediction. The LSTM model captures
sequential dependencies in stock time series data, while Decision
Tree Regression refines predictions with interpretable rules.The
attempt is to combine the advantages of neural networks and
classification-based decision tress. We present a comprehensive
evaluation using various stock components, such as prices, vol-
umes, and technical indicators. Our approach provides valuable
insights for investors and analysts, aiding in making informed
decisions in the complex and unpredictable stock market. The
study employs rigorous formatting, style, and styling techniques
to ensure clarity and readability.
